  abstract={Global warming increases the number and severity of deadly heatwaves. Recent heatwaves often coincided with soil droughts that intensify air temperature but lower air humidity. Since lowering air humidity may reduce human heat stress, the net impact of soil desiccation on the morbidity and mortality of heatwaves remains unclear. Combining weather balloon and satellite observations, atmospheric modelling, and meta-analyses of heatwave mortality, we find that soil droughts—despite their warming effect—lead to a mild reduction in heatwave lethality. More specifically, morning dry soils attenuate afternoon heat stress anomaly by ~5%. This occurs because of reduced surface evaporation and increased entrainment of dry air aloft. The benefit appears more pronounced during specific events, such as the Chicago 1995 and Northern U.S. 2006 and 2012 heatwaves. Our findings suggest that irrigated agriculture may intensify lethal heat stress, and question recently proposed heatwave mitigation measures involving surface moistening to increase evaporative cooling.},

  abstract={The land biosphere is a crucial component of the Earth system that interacts with the atmosphere in a complex manner through manifold feedback processes. These relationships are bidirectional, as climate affects our terrestrial ecosystems, which, in turn, influence climate. Great progress has been made in understanding the local interactions between the terrestrial biosphere and climate, but influences from remote regions through energy and water influxes to downwind ecosystems remain less explored. Using a Lagrangian trajectory model driven by atmospheric reanal- ysis data, we show how heat and moisture advection affect gross carbon production at interannual scales and in different ecoregions across the globe. For water-limited regions, results show a detrimental effect on ecosystem pro- ductivity during periods of enhanced heat and reduced moisture advection. These periods are typically associated with winds that disproportionately come from continental source regions, as well as positive sensible heat flux and negative latent heat flux anomalies in those upwind locations. Our results underline the vulnerability of ecosystems to the occurrence of upwind climatic extremes and highlight the importance of the latter for the spatiotemporal propagation of ecosystem disturbances.},

  title={A precipitation recycling network to assess freshwater vulnerability: Challenging the watershed convention},
  author={Keune, Jessica and Miralles, Diego G.},
  abstract={Water resources and water scarcity are usually regarded as local aspects for which a watershed-based management appears adequate. However, precipitation, as a main source of freshwater, may depend on moisture supplied through land evaporation from outside the watershed. This notion of evaporation as a local “green water” supply to precipitation is typically not considered in hydrological water assessments. Here we propose the concept of a watershed precipitation recycling network, which establishes atmospheric pathways and links land surface evaporation as a moisture supply to precipitation, hence contributing to local but also remote freshwater resources. Our results show that up to 74% of summer precipitation over European watersheds depends on moisture supplied from other watersheds, which contradicts the conventional consideration of autarkic watersheds. The proposed network approach illustrates atmospheric pathways and enables the objective assessment of freshwater vulnerability and water scarcity risks under global change. The illustrated watershed interdependence emphasizes the need for global water governance to secure freshwater availability.},

  abstract={In the hydrologic cycle, continental landmasses constitute a sink for atmospheric moisture as annual terrestrial precipitation commonly exceeds evapotranspiration. Simultaneously, humans intervene in the hydrologic cycle and pump groundwater to sustain, for example, drinking water and food production. Here we use a coupled groundwater-to-atmosphere modeling platform, set up over the European continent, to study the influence of groundwater pumping and irrigation on the net atmospheric moisture import of the continental landmasses, which defines the strength of the continental sink. Water use scenarios are constructed to account for uncertainties of atmospheric feedback during the heatwave year 2003. We find that human water use induces groundwater-to-atmosphere feedback, which potentially weaken the continental sink over arid watersheds in southern Europe. This feedback is linked to groundwater storage, which suggests that atmospheric feedbacks to human water use may contribute to drying of watersheds, thereby raising water resources and socio-economic concerns beyond local sustainability considerations.},

  abstract={The impact of 3D groundwater dynamics as part of the hydrologic cycle is rarely considered in regional climate simulation experiments. However, there exists a spatial and temporal connection between groundwater and soil moisture near the land surface, which can influence the land surface-atmosphere feedbacks during heat waves. This study assesses the sensitivity of bedrock-to-atmosphere simulations to groundwater representations at the continental scale during the European heat wave 2003 using an integrated fully coupled soil-vegetation-atmosphere model. The analysis is based on the comparison of two groundwater configurations: (1) 3D physics-based variably saturated groundwater dynamics and (2) a 1D free drainage (FD) approach. Furthermore, two different subsurface hydrofacies distributions (HFD) account for the uncertainty of the subsurface hydraulic characteristics, and ensemble simulations address the uncertainty arising from different surface-subsurface initial conditions. The results show that the groundwater representation significantly impacts land surface-atmosphere processes. Differences between the two groundwater configurations follow subsurface patterns, and the largest differences are observed for shallow water table depths. While the physics-based setup is less sensitive to the HFD, the parameterized FD simulations are highly sensitive to the hydraulic characteristics of the subsurface. An analysis of variance shows that both, the groundwater configuration and the HFD, induce variability across all compartments with decreasing impact from the subsurface to the atmosphere, while the initial condition has only a minor impact.},

  abstract={Mega-heatwaves are among the deadliest natural disasters in midlatitudes. During such events, the atmospheric circulation is typically governed by persistent anticyclones, enabling cloud-free conditions and advection of hot air. Dry soils in heatwave regions are also known to further contribute to the escalation of air temperatures. However, while local land–atmosphere feedbacks are well studied, the same does not apply to the influence of upwind areas, from where heat is advected. Here we investigate reanalysis data using a Lagrangian heat-tracking model to unravel the role of upwind land–atmosphere feedbacks during the two European mega-heatwaves of this century: the events in 2003 and 2010. Our analysis indicates that advected sensible heat can come in torrents, suddenly and intensely, leading to abrupt increases in air temperatures that further strengthen local land–atmosphere feedbacks via soil desiccation. During both mega-heatwaves, about 30% of the advected sensible heat was caused by the drought upwind. Since subtropical droughts are projected to aggravate during this century, in light of our results, this may be accompanied by consequent intensification of midlatitude mega-heatwaves. We therefore recommend considering not only local, but also upwind land cover and land-use management in the design of adaptation strategies against compound drought–heatwave events.},

  abstract={A detailed representation of plant hydraulic traits and stomatal closure in land surface models (LSMs) is a prerequisite for improved predictions of ecosystem drought response. This work presents the integration of a macroscopic root water uptake (RWU) model based on the hydraulic architecture approach in the LSM of the Terrestrial Systems Modeling Platform. The novel RWU approach is based on three parameters derived from first principles that describe the root system equivalent conductance, the compensatory RWU conductance, and the leaf water potential at stomatal closure, which defines the water stress condition for the plants. The developed RWU model intrinsically accounts for changes in the root density as well as for the simulation of the hydraulic lift process. The standard and the new RWU approach are compared by performing point-scale simulations for cropland over a sheltered minirhizotron facility in Selhausen, Germany, and validated against transpiration fluxes estimated from sap flow and soil water content measurements at different depths. Numerical sensitivity experiments are carried out using different soil textures and root distributions in order to evaluate the interplay between soil hydrodynamics and plant characteristics, and the impact of assuming time-constant plant physiological properties. Results show a good agreement between simulated and observed transpiration fluxes for both RWU models, with a more distinct response under water stress conditions and with uncertainty in the soil parameterization prevailing to the differences due to changes in the model formulation. The hydraulic RWU model exhibits also a lower sensitivity to the root distributions when simulating the onset of the water stress period. Finally, an analysis of variability across the soil and root scenarios indicates that differences in soil water content are mainly influenced by the root distribution, while the transpiration flux in both RWU models is additionally determined by the soil characteristics.},

  abstract={Integrated terrestrial system modeling platforms, which simulate the 3-D flow of water both in the subsurface and the atmosphere, are expected to improve the realism of predictions through a more detailed physics-based representation of hydrometeorological processes and feedbacks. We test this expectation by evaluating simulation results from different configurations of an atmospheric model with increasing complexity in the representation of land surface and subsurface physical processes. The evaluation is performed using observations during the (HD(CP)2) Observational Prototype Experiment field campaign in April–May 2013 over western Germany. The augmented model physics do not improve the prediction of daily cumulative precipitation and minimum temperature during this period. Moreover, a cold bias is introduced in the simulated daily maximum temperature, which decreases the performance of the atmospheric model with respect to its standard configuration. The decreased performance in the maximum temperature is traced in part to a higher simulated soil moisture, which shifts surface flux partitioning toward higher latent and lower sensible heat fluxes. The better reproduced air temperature profiles simulated by the standard atmospheric model comes, however, with an overestimated heat flux at the land surface caused by a warm bias in the simulated soil temperature. Simulated atmospheric states do not correlate significantly with differences in soil moisture and temperature; thus, different turbulent flux parameterizations dominate the propagation of the subsurface signal into the atmosphere. The strong influence of the lateral synoptic forcings on the results suggests, however, the need for further investigations encompassing different weather situations or regions with stronger land-atmosphere coupling conditions.},
